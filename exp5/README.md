# Experiment 5

## 5a: Learn about Stateful and Stateless Widgets

### Aim
To understand the difference between Stateful and Stateless widgets in Flutter.

### Description
Stateless widgets do not maintain state, while Stateful widgets can change dynamically. This experiment demonstrates creating both types of widgets and observing their behavior.

### Output
- Stateless widgets display static content.
- Stateful widgets update UI dynamically based on state changes.

## 5b: Implement state management using setState and Provider

### Aim
To implement state management using setState and Provider.

### Description
State management controls the behavior and data flow of a Flutter app. This experiment demonstrates managing state locally with setState and globally using Provider package.

### Output
- UI updates correctly when state changes.
- Provider allows state sharing across multiple widgets.
